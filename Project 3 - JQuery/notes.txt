The Dom:

    The DOM illustrates the state of a web page at any given time as a tree-like
    structure comprised of parent and children nodes.

    The DOM is the browser's representation of an HTML web page. Because the DOM is HTML
    and to create a web page we use HTML, you may think that the main HTML file is the DOM;
    however, that is not exactly correct. As we said, the DOM is the browser's representation,
    so this means the HTML is actually created by the browser.

    When you want to change your representation of the html make sure that you reference the DOM.

Console tools:

    Finding if a page uses jquery:
    First see if you can use the jQuery tools by typing jQ in the console and seeing if jQuery shows up.
    It does, which means the Thinkful page uses jQuery.
