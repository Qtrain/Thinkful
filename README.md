<h1>Thinkful Tutorial on Front End Design</h1>
<h3>First Project - About me page</h3>
<p>During this lesson you will be coding an "About Me" website based on this example design . You will learn to use CodePen which will then be used to complete this project.</p>

<p>You will plan you page by creating a wireframe. From there you will build your "About Me" page for scratch using HTML and CSS skills. You'll create the page section by section during the lesson. Try not look at the finished code until the end.</p>

<p>You might occasionally experience frustration during this lesson, but stick with it. Solving problems you encounter will help you internalize your new coding skills. And just remember, by the end of the lesson, you will have created your own "About Me" page from scratch.</p>

<h3>Project 2 - Building a landing page from scratch</h3>
<p>For this project, you will clone the landing page of a startup called Karma . Since Karma is a live startup that regularly updates their site, the link above will send you to a previous version of Karma's site.</p>

<h3>Project 3 - JQuery</h3>
<p>Created a web page that loads a hello world dialog.  Also gathered some examples from w3c on JQuery selectors, effects and events.</p>
<h5>To-do</h5>
- add more effects
- add links to more documentation
- explore jquery api
- possibly put all effects into bootstrap?
- add menu?

<h3>Project 4 - Streetfigher</h3>
<p>Create a webpage that uses jquery hide and show effects to animate Ryu from Streetfighter.  He can throw a hadouken - Personally, I think a dragon punch would have been more impressive...</p>

<h3>Project 5 - JQuery shopping list app</h3>
<p>Create a shopping list app (more aptly a to-do list) using concepts learned thus far using html5 semantic tags, css with a focus on positioning and jquery</p>
<h5>To-Do(haha)</h5>
